## I am a husband, father and developer: I'll tell you a little about myself

- I was born in Schorndorf in Germany, but my home is near Naples, Italy, even though my origins are on the island of Sardinia where I lived the first 30 years of my life.

- I studied to be a surveyor, but in the end my passion for computer science is taking me on another path.

- I worked for years as a teacher for a partner company of Autodesk, a large company that develops and distributes software for construction, mechanics and other design software ...

- I currently work for a small IT company where I manage the infrastructure.

- As for the world of information technology, I am totally self-taught: I am very curious and I always like to learn new things.

- 2022 Objectives: 
    - Contribute more to Open Source projects
    - launch a site on php programming with [CodeIgniter 4](https://codeigniter.com/)!
